### <strong>Database
</strong>
<p align="justify">I used Elephant PostgreSQL as the relational database management system for this Django app. The model, depicted in the diagram, visually illustrates the structure of the PostgreSQL database, such as tables, columns, relationships. 
<br>
In terms of data models, there is a User model, which is part of the Django allauth library. This model includes basic information about authenticated users, and has the following fields: username, password, and email.</p>

# Agile
Adopting agile principles and learning Django for the first time presented some initial challenges for me. I needed to work quickly due to the accelerated pace of the project, so I prioritized creating basic functionality first and focusing on meeting pass criteria. As I progressed, I added user stories to GitHub's project and worked on each one for an average of two days.
<br>

While I didn't plan my project from start to finish, using the agile methodology gave me the flexibility to work through each user story as it was added. I found it helpful to prioritize functionality and pass criteria, rather than trying to include everything at once. This allowed me to make progress quickly and adjust my approach as needed. Moving forward, I plan to continue using agile principles to stay flexible and responsive to changing project requirements.
