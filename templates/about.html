                    I'm Jasmin, the blogger and baker behind Wildflour PÃ¢tisserie. I have been a homemaker for many years and I love the
                    French way of baking! That is why I decided to turn my life upside down, move to France and go to pastry school.
                    While I'm there I want to learn as much as possible and I'm excited to share my experiences and knowledge with you!
